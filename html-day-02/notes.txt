1. Semantic Elements in HTML
Definition: Semantic elements are HTML tags that clearly convey their meaning both to the browser and the developer. They describe the structure and purpose of the content inside them.
Importance:
Accessibility: Screen readers and assistive technologies can easily navigate through semantic elements, improving user experience for people with disabilities.
SEO: Search engines better understand the content of your webpage, leading to higher rankings.
Code Readability: Makes the code easier for developers to read and maintain by clearly outlining the structure of the page.


Examples:
<header>: Defines the header of a document.
<nav>: Used for navigation links.
<article>: Represents self-contained content.
<section>: Groups related content.
<footer>: Defines the footer of a document.
<aside>: Represents content aside from the main content.
Interview Tip: Explain why using <div> for everything is bad practice and how semantic elements improve both user and developer experience.

2. HTML Form Elements
Purpose: Forms collect user input and send data to a server.
Common Elements:
<input>: Single-line input (various types).
Types:
text: For basic text input.
password: Hides the input for privacy.
radio: Select one option from a group.
checkbox: Select multiple options.
date: Date selection.
email: For email input (with validation).
Attributes: placeholder, value, name, required
<textarea>: Multi-line text input.
<select>: Dropdown list for selecting options.
<button>: Triggers form submission or other actions.

3. HTML Tables
Purpose: Tables organize data in rows and columns.
Basic Structure:
<table>: Defines the table.
<tr>: Defines a row.
<th>: Defines a header cell (bold and centered by default).
<td>: Defines a regular data cell.

1. <section> tag:
Purpose: The <section> tag is used to define sections of content that are thematically related. A section could group together content based on a common topic or purpose within the document.
Usage: It is ideal for organizing content into different parts, such as chapters, headers, or sections within an article, a webpage, or a blog post.
When to use: Use <section> when you want to group related content together, typically with a heading, but the content may not be independently meaningful.

2. <article> tag:
Purpose: The <article> tag is used to define standalone, self-contained content that can be independently distributed or reused. Examples include blog posts, news articles, or forum entries.
Usage: Content inside an <article> is intended to make sense on its own, outside of the context of the webpage where it's located.
Example:
html
Copy code
<article>
  <h2>How to Learn React</h2>
  <p>React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces...</p>
</article>

When to use: Use <article> when the content is a complete, self-contained piece that can be shared or reused, like a blog post, product review, or news story.
